# ItemRack-2.243
ItemRack 2.243 for TBC 2.4.3 and Wrath 3.3.5 clients. Saving here as it's hard to find. This is not my work and will not be updated.

- ItemRack: The main addon.
- ItemRackOptions: Options and settings for ItemRack. This must be installed alongside ItemRack!
- Broker_ItemRack: A LibDataBroker plugin for managing ItemRack from an LDB panel like Bazooka or ChocolateBar. Optional.
